## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gantt-chart-for-team-leader
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Next.js Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_key_here
```

### 3. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
3. In the Supabase SQL Editor, run the schema from `database_migration.sql`
4. Enable email authentication in Authentication > Settings

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## Database Schema

The application uses a simplified database schema focused on project-level management:

### `profiles`
- User profiles with role-based access
- Links to Supabase auth.users
- Stores user information

### `projects`
- Project information with start and end dates
- Owned by team leader users
- Contains project name, description, timeline, and timestamps
- **New fields**: `start_date`, `end_date` for project timeline

### `project_members`
- Junction table for project team members
- Links users to projects they belong to
- Enables project collaboration

### Removed Tables
- ~~`tasks`~~ - Removed to simplify project management to project-level only

-- 2. Remove the tasks table
-- 3. Set up proper constraints
```

## Simplified Architecture

This application follows a simplified architecture where:
- Each team leader manages projects directly (no separate team entity)
- Projects have start and end dates instead of complex task breakdowns
- Team members are added to specific projects
- The dashboard shows a unified Gantt chart of all projects
- Progress is calculated automatically based on project timeline
- **Focus on project-level planning** rather than detailed task management

This approach reduces complexity while maintaining essential functionality for effective high-level project management.

## Why Simplified?

This version removes task management complexity to focus on:
- **Project-level planning** - Better for high-level project oversight
- **Simplified timeline management** - Just start and end dates
- **Reduced cognitive load** - Fewer entities to manage
- **Faster setup** - Projects can be created and tracked immediately
- **Better for team leaders** - Focus on project outcomes rather than micro-management

Perfect for team leaders who need project visibility without the overhead of detailed task tracking.
